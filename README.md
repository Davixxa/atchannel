# @channel
The goal of this website is to replicate the @channel as seen in the anime Steins;Gate as much as possible. I've been trying to create it based around how it appeared in this picture (which I think might be episode 11):

![@channel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PiJoules/-channel/master/public/@channel.png)

## Todo
- Improve scrolling
- Add ability to switch between styles prtrayed in the anime and the visual novel
- Allow for multiline posts
- Allow for markdown
- Add ability to post images and videos

## Suggestions
Got an idea of a feature you would like to see on the site? Post one [here](http://atchannel.space/Suggestions).
