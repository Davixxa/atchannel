<h1>@channel</h1>

<h2>The Goal</h2>

<p>The goal of this website is to replicate the @channel as seen in the anime Steins;Gate as much as possible.</p>

<p>I've been trying to create it based around how it appeared in this picture (which I think might be episode 11):</p>

<p><img class="sample-photo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PiJoules/-channel/master/public/@channel.png" alt="@channel" /></p>

<h2>What you can do to help</h2>

<p>Obviously, it's not finished, and that's why I need help. I'm having trouble finding the proper assets or pictures necessary to build the website.</p>

<p>For example, I can't seem to find the proper striped, blue background as shown in the picture. I also can't find images of the smiling face anywhere. I'm also unsure what the top of the website actually looks like and what the black line on the right is.</p>

<p>What I need is basically as much information anyone can provide about the site itself, from what content is featured on the site to how to navigate through it. I will also need the any assets or images that are provided in the picture but aren't on the site. A big part of my problem is actually finding pictures. If you guys could send find these for me or redirect them to me somehow, I can include them in the site.</p>

<p>If you do wnat to help out and send me assets, you can either get them to me by posting them in the comments section of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/steinsgate/comments/2xingy/need_help_creating_the_channel_of_steinsgate/" >Reddit Post</a> or submit a new issue on the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/PiJoules/-channel" >Github Repo</a>. (Yes, this project is also open source.)</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <small>I know @channel is based of 2channel, and I tried navigating through it to see if I could copy and design similarities, but I can't actually read Japanese, and Google Translate didn't help that much.</small></p>

<h2>Info I can provide you</h2>

<p>For more appearances of @channel ont he show, it's shown mostly in, I believe, episodes 2, 3, and 11. Here are also some other screencaps I took of it:</p>

<li><a target="_blank" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PiJoules/-channel/master/public/@channel-ep3-1735.png">Episode 3 (17:35)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Also, I know some of the depictions look different like the one in <a target="_blank" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PiJoules/-channel/master/public/@channel-ep2-1218.png">Episode 2 (12:18)</a>, but what I'm trying to create is the one shown in <a target="_blank" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PiJoules/-channel/master/public/@channel-ep3-1735.png">Episode 3 (17:35)</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
