# [@channel](http://atchannel.space/)
The goal of this website is to replicate the @channel from the anime Steins;Gate as much as possible. On the website, you are able to switch between the designs portrayed in both the anime and visual novel.

**@channel as portrayed in the anime**
!["@channel as portrayed in anime"](static/images/@channel.gif "@channel as portrayed in the anime")

**@channel as portrayed in the VN**
!["@channel as portrayed in the VN"](static/images/VN/vn3.png "@channel as portrayed in the VN")
