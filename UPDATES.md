# Updtaes to @channel
All the updates or bug fixes made to @channel as of 8/6/15.

## August 6, 2015
- Fixed bug where not all the previous rows will load when clicking the "load more" button.
- Removed ability to scroll to different posts by clicking on the numbers on the right timeline. Was not able to fix a bug related to oscillating up and down when searching for the post.
- Users no longer leave the page to add a new post. New posts can just be typed on the text box in the bottom and press ENTER to submit it. Consequently:
  - Users are no longer restricted by a captcha when creating new posts.
  - Other posts can no longer be tagged as they could before. A new system that allows posts to reference other posts and users will need to be implemented.
- Fixed bug relating to capcha when creating a new channel.
- Format changes.
